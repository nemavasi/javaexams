Do goodies wear hoodies?

There are a few questions really.

The first question is about clothes at school

I prefer an uniform at schools, or a strong dress code. It is not because I was born in USSR. My arguments are below.
1. The generation gap always exists. But wealth gap exists too. It's not good if some pupils will humiliate other pupils
because of clothes.
2. As you can see the both schools in that article have an uniform!
3. I mean that the school uniform is not only one suit or one dress in all country (like it was in the USSR).
I talk about a few types for boys and a few types for girls. And parents with teachers can choose those types every year
at every school. For example, Maesteg school has two uniforms for boys as minimum. And there are many colors of the same
cardigans, jumpers or sweatshirts. It's cool!
Those clothes can be more safety and healthy for pupils. School is a public place. Any public place can be dangerous for
children. We must protect them. So, if hooded tops are part of the uniform - ok. No problem. Hood is very useful when
it's rainy or cold. I like hooded tops. But if scientific facts and evidencies about hooded tops and troubles in a
specific school exists -ok - let's change the uniform or the dress code at that school.

The second question is about shops. Shops' owners and managers are good when they count their money.
When they say that the new rules are working - I believe them. If some people don't like this - no problem.
There are another shops in the country, or Internet-shops.

Anyway, this article is old today. It was in 2005. Goodies wear hoodies. Robin Hood for example )))
And the normal clothing for monks in the Middle Ages included a hood.
