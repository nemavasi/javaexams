About "The man with the scar"

I don't like this story. Seriously. But may be it is useful for explaining some "false" ideas in some heads
(teenagers' heads, for example). I think the story is a trigger for a lot of interesting discussions, and it's a
good advertising move by the author.
This story would exists in a real life, because some people believe, that there is only one love in entire life. It is
called "true love". And they believe that without this person (as subject of love) their life ends,
and they will have only pain in the future. But it's false.
The man with the scar killed his young wife. He loved her and wanted to prevent a lot of her pain. But it's wrong decision
There is another point of view, If we know that a person can have more then one love, then that decision is only
a terrible murder. His wife had a chance to be happy, may be later, with other man.
May be this chance was slight, but it existed. And murderer continued to live without his wife. He had too many
opportunities to be dead but he wanted to live. It's a vile act.

A lot of people get these ideas about one love from some books (including russians), from their parents and so on.
And we can understand why those ideas have appeared in our life.

There are two main reasons - a religion and diseases. In the Medieval Ages there was bad medicines and some diseases
mean a slow or fast death for a person, without any chance to be health. On the other hand, some religious organizations
use these problems to improve there positions in the population. A lot of people in the Medieval Ages had short life.
They had only one love because they didn't have much time to find others. Like teenagers. But time is a good doctor.
Yes, it very difficult to lose love for some reasons, and the part of this pain will be with you all your life.
But you can meet another person and get a new love. Now most of us have more time to find other person and more
opportunities to do this.
