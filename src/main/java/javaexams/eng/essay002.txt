About "The man with the scar"

I don't like this story. Seriously. But may be it is useful for explaining some "false" ideas in some heads
(teenagers' heads, for example). I think the story is a trigger for a lot of interesting discussions, and it's a
good advertising move by the author.
This story would exists in a real life, because some people believe, that there is only one love in entire life. It is
called "true love". And they believe that without this person their life ends. But it's false.
The man with the scar killed his young wife. He loved her and wanted to prevent a lot of her pain. But it's wrong decision
if we have another point of view, if we know that a person can have more then one love, then that decision is only
a terrible murder.
They get these ideas from some books, from their parents and so on. And we can understand why those ideas have appeared in our life.
There are two main reasons - a religion and diseases. In the Medieval Ages there was bad medicine and some diseases
mean a slow death for person. On the other hand, some religious organizations use these problems to improve there
positions in the population.
